.TH _PRINTF 3 "January 2026" "Holberton School" "Library Functions Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- produce output according to a format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function produces output according to a format string
pointed to by format.
It writes the output to the standard output stream (stdout).

The format string is composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary characters (which are copied unchanged to the output)
and conversion specifications introduced by the '%' character.

This implementation supports the following conversion specifiers:
.TP
.B c
Print a single character.
.TP
.B s
Print a string of characters.
.TP
.B %
Print a literal percent sign.
.TP
.B d, i
Print a signed decimal integer.

If an unsupported conversion specifier is encountered, the percent sign
followed by the unknown specifier is printed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, _printf() returns the number of characters
printed, excluding the null byte used to terminate strings.

If the format string is NULL or ends with a solitary '%', _printf()
returns -1.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
_printf("Character: %c\n", 'A');
_printf("String: %s\n", "Hello");
_printf("Percent: %%\n");
_printf("Number: %d\n", 42);
.fi
